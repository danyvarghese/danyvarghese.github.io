        <h3>Explainable AI</h3>
        
        <p class="institution"> My contributions to Explainable AI (XAI) encompass research, development, 
            mentorship, and industry applications. I have concentrated on improving the transparency and interpretability of AI 
            systems, with a particular emphasis on healthcare and autonomous systems. I developed hybrid models that combine 
            statistical learning with rule-based reasoning to facilitate human-like decision-making. In healthcare, 
            my work included analyzing large datasets, such as those used for Alzheimerâ€™s diagnosis, ensuring that the 
            insights generated were comprehensible and actionable for practitioners. I have also mentored PhD students 
            conducting XAI research, guiding them toward successful publications, and initiated an entrepreneurial 
            venture focused on bringing explainable AI solutions to the finance sector. Furthermore, 
            I designed logic-based frameworks for autonomous systems and XAI, ensuring adherence to 
            legal requirements and building trust in AI-driven decisions.</p>

        <h3>Meta Inverse Entailment (MIE)</h3>
        <p class="institution">Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) 
            stands out for its capacity to leverage domain expertise and produce human-readable, 
            logically sound rules that incorporate common sense reasoning. This approach is efficient, 
            capable of generalizing from limited examples, and particularly adept at learning recursive rules and 
            inventing new predicates and facts from data. MIE's methodological design allows for the extraction 
            and formulation of structured rules directly from sparse datasets, making it invaluable in fields 
            requiring interpretability and rigorous theoretical backing. Its ability to synthesize new knowledge 
            and identify patterns beyond initial observations offers extensive applications across various 
            specialized domains, enhancing both the depth and breadth of potential discoveries and insights.</p>

        <h3>PyGol</h3>
        
        <p class="institution">PyGol is an advanced ILP system designed around the Meta Inverse Entailment (MIE) 
            framework, which significantly enhances the speed and accuracy of learning compared to traditional 
            ILP methods. As a Python-based implementation, PyGol seamlessly integrates with other systems, making 
            it a flexible tool for developing complex reasoning applications. One of its standout features is the 
            ability to perform both abduction (common sense reasoning) and induction within the same framework, 
            facilitating a comprehensive approach to learning from data. This dual capability ensures that PyGol can handle 
            a variety of data types and reasoning tasks efficiently. Additionally, PyGol's data efficiency makes 
            it particularly effective in environments where data is sparse but learning requirements are demanding, 
            providing reliable results even from limited examples.</p>
