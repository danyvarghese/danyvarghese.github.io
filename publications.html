                     This paper presents preliminary work on integrating symbolic learning and reasoning into autonomous maritime systems using inductive logic programming (ILP). 
                     A key challenge in operationalising ILP is bridging the gap between continuous sensing and actuation data and discrete symbolic logic. 
                     We propose a framework that enables autonomous vessels to query maritime rules (COLREGs) and learn from human oversight. 
                     Using the ILP system PyGol, we demonstrate the learning of COLREG Rule 13 for overtaking situations from discretised bearing data, and further explore the 
                     learning of an exception to Rule 15 for crossing situations through examples inspired by case law. These results show the potential for interpretable, 
                     legally compliant decision-making and lay the groundwork for learning more complex rules in dynamic maritime environments.

                     Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) promise to reduce casualty rates and improve operational efficiency, 
                     yet two obstacles impede widespread adoption: the qualitative, often conflicting language of the COLREGs and the opacity of prevailing
                     AI collision-avoidance algorithms. We present a socio-technical decision framework that formalises COLREG hierarchy, 
                     including the \textit{lex specialis} ordering confirmed in \textit{Ever Smart v.\ Alexandra 1}, as a tiered rule tree and encodes 
                     it in an explainable, auditable knowledge base. Using symbolic logic, the system resolves rule conflicts, logs its reasoning, 
                     and outputs a single safe manoeuvre aligned with good seamanship. Three representative scenarios (narrow-channel crossing, 
                     cascading multi-vessel conflict, and overtaking in a channel) demonstrate that the framework reproduces expert decisions 
                     while exposing a transparent proof trail. The result is a legally coherent foundation for logic-based machine learning using 
                     inductive logic programming (ILP) and future maritime autonomous systems trials, advancing the IMO goal of “at least equivalent” safety for unmanned vessels.

                     This paper introduces a symbolic regression framework based on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to address the growing demand for interpretable 
                     machine learning models in sensitive and regulation-intensive domains. Unlike black-box regressors such as ensemble methods or neural networks, 
                     our approach learns human-readable rules that explain how input features relate to output predictions using logic-based representations. 
                     We leverage the PyGol, a novel ILP system, to perform multi-class symbolic regression through a one-vs-rest strategy, where continuous targets 
                     are either preserved or discretised into symbolic labels. Each label is represented by a distinct set of logic rules defined over feature intervals, 
                     facilitating transparent and modular reasoning. A Bayesian-inspired scoring mechanism extends inference to noisy or partially matching instances, 
                     enhancing robustness. Through empirical evaluations on benchmark regression datasets, we demonstrate that PyGol achieves competitive predictive 
                     performance compared to state-of-the-art regressors while offering superior transparency and traceability. We further present sample learned 
                     rules and interpret their behaviour, highlighting the system's explanatory potential. This work affirms the value of ILP-based symbolic models as 
                     viable alternatives to black-box approaches, particularly where accountability and decision interpretability are paramount.

                         Abstract:
                     </strong> 
             
                     Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis relies on integrating heterogeneous behavioral 
                    and cognitive indicators, demanding AI systems that are not only accurate but also 
                    interpretable and verifiable. In this study, we present an explainable ASD detection 
                    framework based on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), using phenotypic data from the 
                    ABIDE dataset. Unlike black-box models, ILP produces symbolic rules in first-order logic, 
                    supporting clinical transparency and auditability. We evaluate ILP against standard machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, 
                    Gradient Boosting) using 10-fold cross-validation and report competitive accuracy, 
                    with ILP demonstrating superior specificity and high precision—critical metrics in 
                    clinical screening. We further compare the interpretability of ILP explanations with 
                    state-of-the-art post-hoc methods, SHAP and LIME, using a held-out test instance. 
                    While all methods identify consistent predictive features, ILP offers globally 
                    consistent, human-readable rules that are more accessible to non-expert users. Our findings affirm ILP as a viable and trustworthy alternative for ASD classification, 
                    providing both predictive utility and symbolic transparency. Future work will extend 
                    this approach to incorporate fMRI-derived features, enabling richer multimodal 
                    reasoning in neurodevelopmental diagnostics.

             <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> "One-shot learning" traditionally 
             
             refers to classifying a single instance using a machine learning model pre-trained on
              extensive datasets. In contrast, Meta Inverse Entailment (MIE), a type of Inductive 
             Logic Programming (ILP), can generate complex logic programs from just a single positive
             example and minimal background knowledge without prior extensive training. This approach 
             offers a human-centred form of machine learning that is more controllable, reliable, 
             and comprehensible due to its small training data size and the inherent interpretability of 
             logic programs. We use PyGol, a Python-based implementation of Meta Inverse Entailment, and 
             compare its performance with ExpGen-PPO, a leading deep reinforcement learning system. 
             Our experiments focus on two domains: maze-solving and obstacle avoidance for mobile 
             robotics. In both domains, we first train the systems in simplified environments without 
             obstacles and then test their ability to generalise to more complex environments with obstacles.
              Our results show that PyGol effectively learns generalisable solutions from a single example 
              in both domains, whereas ExpGen-PPO requires more training and significantly more exploration
               to achieve similar performance.

     significantly improved when it incorporates the grammar learned using MIE. This hybrid 
     approach demonstrates the potential of combining LLMs' linguistic proficiency with MIE's

             we present NumLog, an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) system designed for 
             feature range discovery. NumLog generates quantitative rules with clear confidence bounds 
             to discover feature-range values from examples. Our approach focuses on generating rules
              with minimal complexity from numerical values, ensuring the assessment of methods that 
              could impact accuracy and comprehensibility.
Traditional ILP systems, especially those intersecting with computer vision, struggle with numerical data.
 This convergence presents unique challenges, often hindering the generation of meaningful insights due to
  the limited capabilities of conventional ILP systems to handle numerical values.
NumLog stands out by incorporating an advanced range discovery mechanism that generates low-complexity 
rules while maintaining high accuracy and comprehensibility. This enhancement significantly 
improves interpretability, promoting more effective human-machine learning collaboration.
We compare NumLog with the state-of-the-art ILP systems such as NumSynth and Aleph and conduct 
comprehensive experiments on several datasets. We evaluated our approach by measuring accuracy, 
precision, F1 score, and rule complexity to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology.

                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Traditional machine learning methods heavily rely on large amounts of labelled
                data for effective generalisation, posing a challenge in few-shot learning scenarios. 
                In many real-world applications, acquiring large amounts of training data can be difficult or impossible. 
                This paper presents an efficient and explainable method for few-shot 
                learning from images using inductive logic programming (ILP). 
                ILP utilises logical representations and reasoning to capture complex relationships and
                generalise from sparse data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ILP-based 
                approach through an experimental evaluation focused on detecting neurodegenerative diseases 
                from fundus images. By extending our previous work on neurodegenerative disease detection, 
                including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and vascular dementia disease,
                we achieve improved explainability in identifying these diseases using fundus images 
                collected from the UK Biobank dataset. The logical representation and reasoning inherent 
                in ILP enhances the interpretability of the detection process. The results highlight the 
                efficacy of ILP in few-shot learning scenarios, showcasing its remarkable generalisation
                performance compared to a range of other machine learning algorithms.
                This research contributes to the field of few-shot learning using ILP and 
                paves the way for addressing challenging real-world problems.</p>

                 <b>Dany Varghese</b>, Corinne Vacher, Nika Galic, Valérie Laval,

                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> The functional diversity of microbial 
                communities emerges from a combination of the great number of species and the many interaction 
                types, such as competition, mutualism, predation or parasitism, in microbial
                ecological networks. Understanding the relationship between microbial networks
                 and the functions delivered by the microbial communities is a key challenge 
                 for microbial ecology, particularly as so many of these interactions are
                  difficult to observe and characterise. We believe that this ’Dark Web’ of 
                   interactions could be unravelled using an explainable machine learning approach,
                    called Abductive/Inductive Logic Programming (A/ILP) in the R package InfIntE, 
                    which uses mechanistic rules (interaction hypotheses) to infer directly the network
                     structure and interaction types. Here we attempt to unravel the dark web of the
                      plant microbiome in metabarcoding data sampled from the grapevine foliar microbiome.
                       Using synthetic, simulated data, we first show that it is possible to satisfactorily 
                       reconstruct microbial networks using explainable machine learning.
                        Then we confirm that the dark web of the grapevine microbiome is diverse, 
                        being composed of a range of interaction types consistent with the literature.
                         This first attempt to use explainable machine learning to infer microbial 
                         interaction networks advances our understanding of the ecological processes 
                         that occur in microbial communities and allows us to hypothesise specific
                          types of interaction within the grapevine microbiome. This work will have 
                          potentially valuable applications, such as the discovery of antagonistic interactions
                           that might be used to identify potential biological control agents within 
                           the microbiome.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> 
        Plant diseases are one of the main causes of crop loss in agriculture.
     Machine Learning, in particular statistical and neural nets (NNs) approaches, 
     have been used to help farmers identify plant diseases. However, since new diseases 
     continue to appear in agriculture due to climate change and other factors, 
     we need more data-efficient approaches to identify and classify new diseases 
     as early as possible. Even though statistical machine learning approaches and 
     neural nets have demonstrated state-of-the-art results on many classification tasks, 
     they usually require a large amount of training data. This may not be available for 
     emergent plant diseases. So, data-efficient approaches are essential for an early 
     and precise diagnosis of new plant diseases and necessary to prevent the disease’s spread. 
     This study explores a data-efficient Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) approach for 
     plant disease classification. We compare some ILP algorithms (including our new implementation, 
     PyGol) with several statistical and neural-net based machine learning algorithms on the task of 
     tomato plant disease classification with varying sizes of training data set (6, 10, 50 and 100 
     training images per disease class). The results suggest that ILP outperforms other learning
      algorithms and this is more evident when fewer training data are available.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> 
        Abductive reasoning plays an essential part in day-to-day problem-solving. 
        It has been considered a powerful mechanism for hypothetical reasoning in the 
        presence of incomplete knowledge; a form of “common sense” reasoning. In machine learning, 
        abduction is viewed as a conceptual method in which data and the bond that jointly brings 
        the different types of inference. The traditional Mode-Directed Inverse Entailment (MDIE) 
        based systems such as Progol and Aleph for the abduction were not data-efficient 
        since their execution time with the large dataset was too long. We present 
        a new abductive learning procedure using Meta Inverse Entailment (MIE).
         MIE is similar to Mode-Directed Inverse Entailment (MDIE) but does not 
         require user-defined mode declarations. In this paper, 
         we use an implementation of MIE in Python called PyGol. 
         We evaluate and compare this approach to reveal the microbial 
         interactions in the ecosystem with state-of-art-of methods for abduction, 
         such as Progol and Aleph. Our results show that PyGol has comparable 
         predictive accuracies but is significantly faster than Progol and Aleph.

                 <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> 
         Unlike most computer vision approaches, which depend on hundreds or thousands of 
         training images, humans can typically learn from a single visual example. 
         Humans achieve this ability using background knowledge. 
         Rule-based machine learning approaches such as Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) 
         provide a framework for incorporating domain specific background knowledge. 
         These approaches have the potential for human-like learning from small 
         data or even one-shot learning, i.e. learning from a single positive example. 
         By contrast, statistics based computer vision algorithms, including Deep Learning, 
         have no general mechanisms for incorporating background knowledge. 
         This paper presents an approach for one-shot rule learning called 
         One-Shot Hypothesis Derivation (OSHD) based on using a logic program declarative bias. 
         We apply this approach to two challenging human-like computer vision tasks: 1)
          Malayalam character recognition and 2) neurological diagnosis using retinal images. 
          We compare our results with a state-of-the-art Deep Learning approach, called Siamese Network, 
          developed for one-shot learning. 
          The results suggest that our approach can generate human-understandable 
          rules and outperforms the deep learning approach with a significantly higher average 
          predictive accuracy.
